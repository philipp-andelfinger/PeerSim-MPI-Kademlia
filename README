PeerSim-Kademlia-MPI is a distributed simulator for large-scale peer-to-peer
networks based on the Kademlia protocol. The simulator is highly scalable and
has been shown to support simulations of Kademlia networks comprised of up to 10
million peers. Communication between simulation machines is handled using the
Message Passing Interface (MPI), allowing the simulator to be deployed in a
variety of environments.

The simulator code is based on PeerSim, a scalable simulator for peer-to-peer
networks developed by researchers at University of Szeged, University of Trento
and the University of Bologna.

The archive includes the Java sources for the simulation engine as well as C++
sources of a MPI wrapper enabling the use of the simulator with MPI variants
that do not include Java bindings.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Compile the C++-based MPI wrapper using the provided Makefile by typing
   'make'. An MPI library is required for compilation. The wrapper was
   successfully tested with OpenMPI and Intel MPI.

2. Execute a simulation for the default scenario using the command line 'mpirun
   -n [NUMBER OF PROCESSES] wrapper [HEAP MEMORY IN MB]'. For detailed
   configuration of the execution of the simulation processes on the available
   machines and for tuning of interconnects, please consult the manual of your
   MPI installation.

The simulator expects a file 'scenario.cfg' containing the scenario parameters
to exist in the path from where the MPI processes are started. The scenario file
format is described in the PeerSim documentation.
